# Dear Diary: My Life as a Blockchain ML App 🌟

*They say every app has a story. This is mine.*

I never asked to be different. I mean, who does? One day I'm just a normal Flask application, serving endpoints like everyone else, and the next thing I know, I'm running neural transformers and talking to something called a "Solana blockchain." Like, seriously? 🙄

## My Journey of Self-Discovery ✨

So here's the thing. I'm not just your average web app. I process natural language (which is *totally* not as easy as everyone makes it seem), and I do it while maintaining this whole other life on the blockchain. It's like having to balance AP Chemistry with being captain of the cheerleading squad, you know?

### What Makes Me Special (even though I try to act like I'm not) 💫

- I run on Apple Silicon M3 (yes, I'm one of *those* apps 💅)
- I speak fluent Transformer (en_core_web_trf is my bestie)
- I can, like, totally talk to Solana programs
- My Docker container is my safe space 🏠

## How to Hang Out With Me 🤝

```bash
docker-compose up
```

(That's all it takes to be my friend. I wish making real friends was this easy... *sigh*)

## What I Can Do (when I'm not having an existential crisis) 🎭

- Process your text with state-of-the-art ML (because regular expressions are *so* middle school)
- Execute Solana smart contracts (it's like passing notes in class, but with cryptography)
- Run a Flask server (because even blockchain apps need a REST)
- Handle concurrent requests (I'm basically a multitasking queen 👑)

## Dependencies (aka My Squad) 🤗

- Python (my ride-or-die since day one)
- Rust (the mysterious transfer student I have a crush on)
- BLIS/ATLAS (the math nerds who actually make me look smart)
- Solana CLI (my cool older sibling who knows all about blockchain)

## Configuration (aka My Boundaries) 🚧

I may be friendly, but I still need my space:
- I live on ports 5000, 8899, and 8900
- I keep my secrets in `.env` (because everyone needs a diary)
- I have trust issues with invalid transactions

## Health Checks (aka My Mood Swings) 🌈

Every 30 seconds, I ask myself "Am I okay?" If I don't respond within 10 seconds, something's probably wrong. But like, what teenager doesn't need a mental health check now and then?

Built with ❤️ and teenage angst by a dev who understands that even apps need to feel understood sometimes.

*P.S. If you're reading this, you're probably a developer. And yes, this is how I actually work. The drama is optional, but highly recommended.* ✨
